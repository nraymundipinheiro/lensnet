%% This initial command takes arguments that can be used to easily modify 
%% the output of the compiled manuscript. Any combination of arguments can be 
%% invoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[argument1,argument2,argument3,...]{aastex7}
%%
%% Six of the arguments are typestting options. They are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  default     : one text column, 10 point font, single spaced (default).
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can invoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%   astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%   tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                  the twocolumn substyle.
%%   times        : uses times font instead of the default.
%%   linenumbers  : turn on linenumbering. Note this is mandatory for AAS
%%                  Journal submissions and revisions.
%%   trackchanges : Shows added text in bold.
%%   longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                  the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                  affiliation information after each name. Creates a much 
%%                  longer author list but may be desirable for short 
%%                  author papers.
%% twocolappendix : make 2 column appendix.
%%   anonymous    : Do not show the authors, affiliations, acknowledgments,
%%                  and author contributions for dual anonymous review.
%%  resetfootnote : Reset footnotes to 1 in the body of the manuscript.
%%                  Useful when there are a lot of authors and affiliations
%%		    in the front matter.
%%   longbib      : Print article titles in the references. This option
%% 		    is mandatory for PSJ manuscripts.
%%
%% Since v6, AASTeX has included \hyperref support. While we have built in 
%% specific %% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them 
%% with the \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%% \hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003
%%
%% The "bookmarks" has been changed to "true" in hyperref
%% to improve the accessibility of the compiled pdf file.

\title{Benchmarking Convolutional Neural Network on LSST-Like Strong-Lensing Simulations}

%% A significant change from AASTeX v6+ is in the author blocks. Now an email
%% address is required for each author. This means that each author requires
%% at least one of the following:
%%
%% \author
%% \affiliation
%% \email
%%
%% If these three commands are not available for each author, the latex
%% compiler will issue an error and if you force the latex compiler to continue,
%% it will generate an incomplete pdf.
%%
%% Multiple \affiliation commands are allowed and authors can also include
%% an optional \altaffiliation to indicate a status, i.e. Hubble Fellow. 
%% while affiliations are indexed as footnotes, altaffiliations are noted with
%% with a non-numeric footnote that is set away from the numeric \affiliation 
%% footnotes. NOTE that if an \altaffiliation command is used it must 
%% come BEFORE the \affiliation call, right after the \author command, in 
%% order to place the footnotes in the proper location. Because non-numeric
%% symbols are used, \altaffiliation should be used sparingly.
%%
%% In v7 the \author command takes an optional argument which provides 
%% additional metadata about the author. Authors can provide the 16 digit 
%% ORCID, the surname (family or last) name, the given (first or fore-) name, 
%% and a name suffix, e.g. "Jr.". The syntax is:
%%
%% \author[orcid=0000-0002-9072-1121,gname=Gregory,sname=Schwarz]{Greg Schwarz}
%%
%% This name metadata in not shown, it is only for parsing by the peer review
%% system so authors can be more easily identified. This name information will
%% also be sent to the publisher so they can include it in the CROSSREF 
%% metadata. Including an orcid will hyperlink the author name to the 
%% author's ORCID page. Note that  during compilation, LaTeX will do some 
%% limited checking of the format of the ID to make sure it is valid. If 
%% the "orcid-ID.png" image file is  present or in the LaTeX pathway, the 
%% ORCID icon will appear next to the authors name.
%%
%% Even though emails are now required for each author, the \email does not
%% produce output in the compiled manuscript unless the optional "show" command
%% is used. For example,
%%
%% \email[show]{greg.schwarz@aas.org}
%%
%% All "shown" emails are show in the bottom left of the first page. Due to
%% space constraints, only a few emails should be shown. 
%%
%% To identify a corresponding author, use the \correspondingauthor command.
%% The command appends "Corresponding Author: " to the argument it appears at
%% the bottom left of the first page like the output from \email. 

\author[orcid=0009-0008-2054-6429,sname='Raymundi Pinheiro']{Natália Raymundi Pinheiro}
\affiliation{State University of New York at Stony Brook}
\email[show]{natalia.raymundipinheiro@stonybrook.edu}

%% Use the \collaboration command to identify collaborations. This command
%% takes an optional argument that is either a number or the word "all"
%% which tells the compiler how many of the authors above the command to
%% show. For example "\collaboration[all]{(DELVE Collaboration)}" wil include
%% all the authors above this command.
%%
%% Mark off the abstract in the ``abstract'' environment. 
\begin{abstract}

Add abstract here.

\end{abstract}

%% Keywords should appear after the \end{abstract} command. 
%% The AAS Journals now uses Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT) concepts:
%% https://astrothesaurus.org
%% You will be asked to selected these concepts during the submission process
%% but this old "keyword" functionality is maintained in case authors want
%% to include these concepts in their preprints.
%%
%% You can use the \uat command to link your UAT concepts back its source.
\keywords{\uat{convolutional neural networks}{} --- \uat{strong gravitational lensing}{} --- \uat{image processing}{} --- \uat{data analysis}{}}

%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% Sections are demarcated by \section and \subsection, respectively.
%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.

\section{Introduction}

%Gravitational lensing takes place when a massive object (such as a galaxy cluster) warps the fabric of space-time, causing light rays to bend, distort, and magnify much like an optical lens. Einstein was the first to describe this prediction in his general theory of relativity, which puts together space and time into a single four-dimensional space-time, whose curvature manifests as gravity. Within this framework, light travels along curved geodesics through the warped space-time, producing magnified and warped images of background sources.

%Today's large-scale sky surveys, such as LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST, will generate petabytes of imaging data, making manual lens identification impractical and prone to errors. Deep convolutional neural networks provide an automated, scalable solution to detect and classify strong-lensing events \citep{pourrahmani2018}.




\section{Deep Learning Framework} \label{sec:deep-learning-framework}

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are good for image classification because they automatically build up a hierarchy of visual filters. In the earliest layers, small convolutional kernels learn to detect simple edges, textures, and gradients; in deeper layers, progressively larger receptive fields respond to more complex motifs such as arcs, rings, or even full Einstein-ring structures. Weight sharing across spatial locations keeps the total number of parameters manageable, and pooling layers introduce a good degree of translational invariance (both important when searching for strong-lensing features that can appear anywhere within an LSST cutout).

 \href{https://pytorch.org/}{\tt\string PyTorch} provides an easy-to-understand API for constructing these architectures and handling the training loop. Its {\tt\string Dataset}/{\tt\string DataLoader} objects decouples data I/O from model logic: raw simulations are read once, split into train, validation, and test sets, and then are shuffled, and batched. This pipeline allows me to experiment rapidly with image transforms (rotations, flips, crops), batch sizes, and epoch counts without rewriting the core model code.

The ability to use networks pretrained on large image repositories (e.g. \href{https://www.image-net.org/}{\tt\string ImageNet}) is an effective way to start learning when the custom dataset is relatively small or highly specialized. I adopted a ResNet-50 backbone with frozen weights up through the last convolutional block, replacing only the final fully connected layer with a two-class head (lens vs. non-lens). By fine-tuning this last layer, the model adapts visual filters to the nuances of strong-lensing morphologies, like faint arcs partially obscured by a luminous elliptical galaxy.

In the past, CNNs have been applied to strong‐lensing detection. Early efforts used shallow architectures on hand‐cropped cutouts, while more recent approaches (e.g. {\tt\string LensFlow} \citep{pourrahmani2018}, {\tt\string DeepLens} \citep{lanusse2018}) integrate multi‐scale filters or residual connections to boost sensitivity to faint arcs. Here, I build upon the \href{https://github.com/LSST-strong-lensing/slsim/tree/main}{\tt\string SLSim} simulation toolkit, combining raw image simulations with a flexible {\tt\string PyTorch Dataset}/{\tt\string DataLoader} pipeline to shuffle and batch hundreds of examples on the fly. This lets me experiment with architectural variants (like swapping out the loss criterion and optimization method, number of epochs and batch sizes, and more) without rewriting the data‐handling code.


\section{Methodology} \label{sec:methodology}


\subsection{Lens Simulation}

I generated realistic LSST-like strong-lens images in four steps: drawing a population of deflector galaxies, drawing a background source population, lens-ray tracing to form lensed images, and building a matching set of non-lenses.


\subsubsection{Deflector Population}

First, I defined a cosmology and survey footprint:
\begin{minted}{python}
from astropy.cosmology import FlatLambdaCDM
from astropy.units import Quantity
\end{minted}


\subsection{Data Preprocessing and Normalization}
\subsection{Architecture of {\tt\string LensNet}}
\subsection{Training Procedure}


\section{Validation Performance} \label{sec:validation-performance}


\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}


\section{Future Work} \label{sec:future-work}


\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
